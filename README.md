# AudioEngine
This is my Audio Engine, that is designed and built upon ALSA, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
It's purpose and motivation was primarily a learning experience, and I needed/need a sound engine for my OpenGL projects. As it's currently built upon ALSA, it's likely only supported by Linux systems, unless something in the future is to change.
